<h2>Projects</h2>
<p>I am currently working on an exciting project to create a gallery of AI-generated photos using generative AI tools. This gallery is designed to explore the creative potential of artificial intelligence in visual arts, experimenting with different styles, themes, and concepts to produce unique and striking images. The project not only showcases the capabilities of modern AI in generating realistic and imaginative visuals, but also serves as a platform to learn and refine techniques in image generation, curation, and presentation. Through this ongoing work, I aim to blend technology and creativity, pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved with AI while building a portfolio of innovative digital artwork that reflects both technical skill and artistic vision.</p>
